  <h3>October 28, 2024</h3>
  <p>Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday condemned the tone of former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden the night before, arguing that it underscored her campaign’s argument against him.</p>
  <p>“I think last night, Donald Trump’s event in Madison Square Garden really highlighted a point that I’ve been making throughout this campaign,” Harris told reporters before heading to Michigan. “He is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country.”</p>
